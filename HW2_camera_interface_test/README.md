# computer_graphics HW2

### When the user holds down the left mouse button and moves the mouse horizontally, the camera should change its longitude by some increment proportional to the motion of the mouse. Moving the mouse vertically should change the camera's latitude. (Recall that longitude lines run through the poles of a globe, and latitude lines run parallel to the equator.) Intuitively, the camera is moving over the surface of an imaginary sphere enclosing the object being viewed. By holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse vertically, the user should be able to move the camera closer to or farther away from the center of the sphere, thus altering the radius of the sphere. The camera should always point towards the origin of the world coordinate system.

### "a" : toggle display of coordinate axes
### "s" : toggle display of object 
### "p" : toggle between perspective and orthogonal projection (this is already in the template, we will learn more about projections later in the semester)
### "q" : exit program
